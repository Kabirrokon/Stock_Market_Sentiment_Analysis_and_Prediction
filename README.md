Stock Market Sentiment Analysis and Prediction
Objective:
To predict stock prices by combining market sentiment analysis from social media (Twitter) with historical stock price data using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks.

 Why This Project is Valuable:
1.	Market Relevance: Stock prediction is highly valuable in finance and investment.
2.	Combining Two Data Sources: It’s unique because it merges real-time sentiment data from Twitter with historical financial data.
3.	Skill Demonstration: Uses advanced deep learning techniques and data collection methods, making it stand out on your resume.

 How the Project Works:
1.	Data Collection:
o	Uses the Twitter API to fetch recent tweets related to a specific stock (like Apple or Tesla).
o	Uses Yahoo Finance API to gather historical stock prices (like opening, closing, and volume).
o	Combines these data sources into a single dataset.

2.	Sentiment Analysis:
o	Analyzes the emotion and sentiment behind tweets (like positive, negative, or neutral).
o	Uses libraries like TextBlob and NLTK to calculate a sentiment score for each tweet.

3.	Data Processing:
o	Prepares both sentiment data and historical stock data for model training.
o	Normalizes the data to ensure consistent scaling.
o	Uses sliding windows to create sequences of past data for time-series prediction.

4.	Building the Prediction Model:
o	Uses an LSTM neural network to predict the next day’s stock price.
o	Trains the model on the combined sentiment and historical data.
o	LSTM is ideal because it captures long-term dependencies in sequential data.

5.	Prediction and Visualization:
o	Uses the trained model to make predictions and compare them with actual prices.
o	Plots actual vs. predicted prices to evaluate performance.
